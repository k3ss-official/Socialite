# Socialite Project

## Overview

Socialite is a conceptualized business-in-a-box platform designed to enable local businesses, especially those lacking an online presence, to quickly and affordably establish themselves on the web. The platform aims to simplify website creation by leveraging AI-driven site generation principles and integrating existing online content, such as from Facebook business pages.

## Core Components

The platform is built around a modular dashboard system consisting of three main parts:

1.  **Login Dashboard:** Handles user authentication.
2.  **Search Dashboard:** Allows users (e.g., digital agencies) to find and identify potential local business clients, particularly those without existing websites.
3.  **Build Dashboard:** A template-based website editor where users can create and customize websites for businesses. It includes features for template switching and simulated integration of Facebook page content.

## Current Status

*   **MVP (Minimum Viable Product):** The project is currently at the MVP stage.
*   **Front-End Implemented:** The front-end functionality for the Login, Search, and Build dashboards is implemented and demonstrable (though live demonstration has faced persistent external connectivity issues).
*   **Key Features (Simulated/Placeholder):** User authentication, business search (with placeholder data), template selection, and basic Facebook content application (simulated) are present.
*   **Documentation:** Handover documentation (`handover_report.md`) and a status report (`status_report.md`) detailing the project state, next steps, and interim goals are included in this repository.

## Technology (Front-End MVP)

*   HTML
*   CSS (utilizing CSS variables for theming)
*   JavaScript (for client-side interactivity and dashboard logic)

## Next Steps & Future Development

The primary focus for future development includes:

*   **Backend Development:** Building the necessary backend infrastructure for user management, database storage, and API creation.
*   **Google Places API Integration:** To fetch real local business data for the Search Dashboard.
*   **Facebook Content Scraping (Crawl4AI):** To integrate real Facebook page content into the Build Dashboard.
*   **Full Implementation of Editing Tools:** Enhancing the Build Dashboard with fully functional text editing, image replacement, color scheme application, and save/publish capabilities.
*   **Deployment:** Setting up a stable hosting environment.

This repository contains the front-end MVP code and associated documentation for the Socialite project.
