# Socialite Project Status Report (May 5, 2025)

## Current Status

*   **Handover Complete:** The project handover process is complete. All available assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript for Login, Search, and Build dashboards) and documentation (Handover Report, extracted page content) have been processed and organized.
*   **Repository Updated:** The GitHub repository ([https://github.com/k3ss-official/Socialite](https://github.com/k3ss-official/Socialite)) has been updated with all project files, including:
    *   `login_dashboard.html`
    *   `search_dashboard.html`
    *   `build_dashboard.html`
    *   `styles.css`
    *   `script.js`
    *   `handover_report.md` (Detailed documentation based on initial handover)
    *   `docs/full_page_extract.md` (Raw content extracted from the handover site)
*   **MVP Front-End:** The front-end components represent a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) demonstrating the core user flow and features (login simulation, business search results display, template switching, simulated Facebook content application).
*   **Demonstration Issues:** Attempts to demonstrate the MVP using a simple Python web server and exposed ports (8000, 8080, 15732) encountered persistent connectivity issues (`ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE`), preventing external access despite local server functionality being confirmed. This suggests potential issues with the port exposure service or network environment, rather than the project code itself.

## Next Steps (Immediate)

1.  **Backend Development:** Initiate development of the backend infrastructure. This will be crucial for:
    *   User authentication and management.
    *   Database setup for storing user data, business information, and saved website configurations.
    *   Creating API endpoints to handle requests from the front-end dashboards.
2.  **Google Places API Integration:**
    *   Obtain a Google Places API key.
    *   Implement API calls within the backend to fetch real local business data based on search queries from the Search Dashboard.
    *   Update the Search Dashboard front-end to display real data retrieved from the backend API, replacing the current placeholder results.
3.  **Facebook Content Scraping (Crawl4AI):**
    *   Set up Crawl4AI (or an alternative scraping solution) within the backend environment.
    *   Develop a backend process triggered by the "Facebook It" button on the Search Dashboard.
    *   Implement scraping logic to extract relevant content (profile info, about text, posts, contact details) from a target Facebook business page.
    *   Create backend API endpoints to serve this scraped data to the Build Dashboard.
    *   Update the Build Dashboard front-end (`script.js`) to fetch and apply real Facebook data from the backend API, replacing the current simulation.
4.  **Refine Build Dashboard Functionality:**
    *   Implement the actual logic for the editing tools (Text Editing, Images, Colors) to modify the website template based on user input and backend interactions.
    *   Implement the "Save" and "Publish" functionality, requiring backend logic to store website configurations and potentially deploy static site files.

## Interim Goals

1.  **Functional Search:** Achieve a working Search Dashboard that uses the Google Places API via the backend to display real local businesses based on user searches.
2.  **Basic Facebook Integration:** Implement the backend scraping process and API endpoints to successfully fetch basic information from a Facebook page and display it in the Build Dashboard's Facebook Content panel.
3.  **Content Application:** Enable the "Apply Facebook Content" button in the Build Dashboard to populate the selected website template preview with the *real* fetched Facebook data.
4.  **Stable Demonstration/Testing Environment:** Establish a more robust development/staging environment (potentially using a proper web framework like Flask/Django/Node.js and a cloud hosting platform) to overcome the limitations encountered with the simple Python server and port exposure for reliable testing and demonstration.
