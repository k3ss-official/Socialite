# Socialite Project Status Report (May 14, 2025)

## Current Status

*   **Handover Preparation:** Project is being prepared for handover to Genspark for continued MVP development.
*   **MVP Scope Refined:** Based on recent discussions, the MVP scope has been further refined to focus on core functionality and user experience, with some advanced features placeholder for V2.
*   **Repository Updated:** The local project repository (`/home/ubuntu/Socialite_repo`) contains all current assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript for Login, Search, and Build dashboards) and documentation (`handover_report.md` including "magic" animation UX, `README.md`, this `status_report.md`, and the `Genspark Creative Doc.pdf` in `documentation_references/`).
*   **Key UI/UX Elements:**
    *   Login Dashboard: UI/UX updated as per detailed PDF reference and user feedback.
    *   "Magic" Build Animation: A core UX requirement for the Build Dashboard to simulate on-the-fly site generation and template switching, enhancing perceived value. User will provide SOTA video AI-generated animations for this.

## Refined MVP Scope & Next Steps for Genspark

**Core User Journey for MVP:** Find Business -> Scrape Facebook Content -> Populate Initial Template -> Basic Edit -> Swap to One Alternate Template -> Get Shareable Live Link.

1.  **Login Dashboard:**
    *   Implement as per the refined UI/UX specifications (error handling, attempt counters, 3-button recovery options, visual fidelity to `Genspark Creative Doc.pdf`).

2.  **Search Dashboard:**
    *   Integrate with Google Places API (as per Tony's work) to parse and display 5 live search results.
    *   Ensure "Build It" button is functional for all 5 results, leading to the Build Dashboard and passing the selected business context.

3.  **Build Dashboard - Initial Build & Content Scraping:**
    *   On clicking "Build It", transition to Build Dashboard.
    *   Implement Facebook content scraping using Crawl4AI for the chosen business (publicly available text, images, contact details).
    *   Populate a **single, default, well-chosen static landing page template** with the scraped Facebook content.
    *   Implement the **"Magic" Build Animation (Initial):**
        *   Display a high-quality, blurred animation (color-matched to the default template, provided by user via SOTA video AI) suggesting site construction.
        *   Incorporate intermittent, friendly, on-screen status updates during the animation (e.g., "Ok, we about to get BUSY!!", "Your site is in the oven!", "Oh boy, youâ€™re gonna LOVE this!") to manage perceived wait time.
        *   Animation smoothly disintegrates to reveal the populated default template.

4.  **Build Dashboard - Basic Editing (MVP V1):**
    *   **Text Editing:** Allow users to click on predefined editable text regions within the populated template and modify content via simple input fields or modals (not full chat-based editing for MVP V1).
    *   **Image Replacement:** Allow users to click on predefined image placeholders and replace them with uploaded images or images from a simple selection mechanism (e.g., URL input).
    *   **"Live Edit" Button:** Placeholder this feature. When clicked, a call-out/modal should appear stating: "Full Live Edit mode is coming in V2 - not long now!" or similar.
    *   **Constrained Editing:** Ensure edits do not break the fundamental framework or responsiveness of the template.

5.  **Build Dashboard - Template Swap (MVP V1 - Simplified):**
    *   Provide a carousel or selection mechanism for **one alternate landing page template** (in addition to the default one).
    *   When the user chooses to apply this alternate template:
        *   Implement the **"Magic" Build Animation (Template Swap):**
            *   Display a high-quality, blurred animation (color-matched to the *newly selected* alternate template, provided by user) suggesting site reconstruction.
            *   Incorporate intermittent, friendly status updates as above.
            *   Animation smoothly disintegrates to reveal the site content re-populated into the chosen alternate template. (Note: Since templates are pre-made with dummy content as per user clarification, this is about populating the *new* template structure with the *original* scraped Facebook data, or if simpler for MVP, re-triggering scrape & populate for the new template structure).

6.  **Build Dashboard - AI-Powered "Suggest" Button:**
    *   Placeholder this entire feature for V2. If a button is shown, it should trigger a message like: "AI Suggestions are coming in V2 - you are going to love this!".
    *   (If any minimal AI text suggestion is considered for MVP V1, it should be limited to very simple transformations like tone adjustment, with clear UI for loading/rejection. Image AI via stock photos is a good V1 fallback if the placeholder is not preferred).

7.  **Publish Button (MVP V1 - Simplified):**
    *   Implement a "Publish" button that generates a live, shareable link to the built/edited static site (e.g., using a simple static hosting solution or temporary link generation).
    *   The feature to email the link to the user or the business owner is deferred post-MVP.

8.  **"Pitch" Tab & Automation:**
    *   Defer this entire module to post-MVP. For MVP V1, the focus is on generating the shareable live link from the Publish button.

## Key Deliverables for Genspark (in Handover ZIP):

*   All current HTML, CSS, JavaScript files.
*   `handover_report.md` (including detailed "Magic" animation UX requirements).
*   This updated `status_report.md` (reflecting refined MVP scope).
*   `README.md`.
*   `Genspark Creative Doc.pdf` (in `documentation_references/`).
*   Existing template files.

## Interim Goals (for Genspark based on refined MVP):

1.  **Functional Login:** Secure and working login page as per UI/UX specs.
2.  **Functional Search & Build Trigger:** Search dashboard retrieves 5 live results; "Build It" correctly initiates the build process for the selected business.
3.  **Core Build & "Magic" Part 1:** Facebook content scraped and populates the default template, showcased with the initial "Magic" build animation and status updates.
4.  **Basic Editing Implemented:** Users can perform simple text and image edits on the populated default template.
5.  **Template Swap & "Magic" Part 2:** User can switch to the one alternate template, with content re-populated, showcased with the second "Magic" build animation and status updates.
6.  **Live Link Generation:** "Publish" button generates a shareable live link of the current site state.
7.  **Placeholder V2 Features:** Clearly indicated placeholders for deferred features (Live Edit advanced functions, AI Suggest, full Pitch tab).
